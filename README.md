# Native Forensics #
Forensics utilities that we've created.  Considering the Daubert evidence standards, it seems to us that being
transparent and open with regards to precisely how we capture and process information will benefit all of us.

Much of the initial work was based upon Chet Hosmer's book "Python Forensics".  In the book, he
advocates building your own sets of tools. Most of his examples were written for Python 2.7, while I'm using 3.4 and
committed to staying current.

I've put these under the GNU v3 license. I chose that as it explicitly grants right to use for commercial purposes.
You are responsible for anything that you do with them.  Do the right thing and treat people the way that you would
like to be treated.

I've tried to comment everything. I'm always open to constructive feedback.
